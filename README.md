# Welcome to my GitHub

It's still new and I'm still working on it so it's not complete yet.
I will gradually publish my work here.

### Who am I ?

I'm Mohamed aka Mimo and i'm a student and developer.

**I do game development on Unity and Unreal engine.**

I intend to publish some of my projects on itch.io soon, I'll put the links here when it's done (And may even make some of the repositories public here on GitHub).

**I also do development on asp.net in C#, on Node.js and others.**

I should soon be publishing some of these projects here.

***Come visit [My Portflio](http://mimolol.github.io/)***

I'm still working on it, it only contains a few projects now.
